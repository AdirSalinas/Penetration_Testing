# Penetration Testing Project
### Short Purpose Of The Project
This project involves creating a script for comprehensive network device mapping, 
identifying ports, services, and vulnerabilities. The user defines the network range, after 
which the program deploys tools like nmap and masscan for scanning and mapping 
purposes, storing the data in a newly created directory. The script also probes for network 
vulnerabilities, employing nmap, searchsploit, hydra, and medusa to identify security gaps, 
such as weak passwords. Finally, the scan summary and findings are presented to the user.

## Why Do We Need This Kind of Project ? 
- [ ] **Risk Mitigation After Breaches:**
      
In the aftermath of security breaches and data leaks, understanding the vulnerabilities in a 
company's network infrastructure becomes crucial. This project provides a systematic 
approach to identifying potential security gaps, aiding cyber analysts in understanding the 
breach and devising strategies to mitigate future risks.

- [ ] **Efficiency in Analysis:**
      
Manual execution of network scans and vulnerability assessments can be labor-intensive 
and time-consuming, especially in large-scale environments. Automating these processes 
allows for quicker detection of vulnerabilities and enables cyber analysts to focus their 
efforts on analyzing results and implementing remediation measures promptly.

- [ ] **Scalability for Complex Networks:**
      
As network infrastructures grow in complexity and scale, manual scanning becomes 
impractical. Automation provides a scalable solution that can adapt to varying network 
configurations, allowing for comprehensive assessment of even the largest and most 
intricate networks.

### Project Structure :
The script is structured as a framework designed to accommodate various network 
analysis needs. Its modular design incorporates multiple menus, each menu 
responsible for specific tasks, empowering analysts to customize their scans 
according to their requirements. Analysts can choose from a range of tools, 
including Nmap, Masscan, searchsploit, hydra, and medusa, based on their specific 
analysis requirements.    

This flexibility enables them to leverage the most 
appropriate tools for each scanning task, maximizing the effectiveness of their 
analysis efforts.
